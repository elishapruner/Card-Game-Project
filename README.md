CSI 2372: Advanced Programming Concepts in C++
Project: CardGame

The purpose of this project was to create a card game to gather, trade, and
sell gemstones.

The game is implemented with several supporting classes including:
- A GemStones class that defines each gemstone
- A CardFactory class to create the cards of different gemstones
- A Deck class to draw cards from during the game
- A Hand class handles the players cards in their hand
- A DiscardPile class to discard cards
- A TradeArea class to allow trades
- A Table class that manages all of the game components
- A Player class that defines the player

In the main file, we initialize the players, set up the table, and execute the
game.
